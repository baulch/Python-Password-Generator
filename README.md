# Python-Password-Generator
Python Password Generator using the random module import. fPPG.py and wPPG.py are relatively simple and were used as a simple project for myself. Similarly, wPPG2.py is also a project, but there is no reason why it can't be used in a business setting.

fPPG.py is a for-looped python password generator (fPPG) with the criteria listed below:

    6 - 18 characters long
    contains at least one lowercase letter
    contains at least one uppercase letter
    contains at least one number
    contains only alphanumeric characters (no special characters)

wPPG.py is a while-looped python password generator (wPPG) with the criteria listed below:

    6 - 20 characters long
    contains at least one lowercase letter
    contains at least one uppercase letter
    contains at least one number
    contains only alphanumeric characters (no special characters)
wPPG2.py is a strong while-looped python password generator with an additional criteria marker:

    + contains at least one special character:    !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
